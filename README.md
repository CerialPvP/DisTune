## DisTune

This is the new version of DisTune, made fully on JavaScript with the help of the **discord.js** NodeJS library.

Interested in the Skript version? Visit the public archive [here](https://github.com/CerialPvP/distune-sk).

> Why did you move off of Skript?

With every new update of [DiSky](https://github.com/DiSkyOrg/DiSky/releases/tag/4.4.3) (the Skript addon for Discord stuff), the syntax changes drastically. In the lastest update (at the time of writing this, it is 4.4.3), the syntax for sending embeds and storing it has changed, and that will affect most of DisTune's code.

Because DisTune is going to be a **long term** bot, DiSky is not the fit. It is an addon for a simple Discord to Minecraft or just basic commands, but if I want this bot to actually be popular, welp, mission impossible with DiSky, since it does not have sharding support.

Now, you might be asking, what is sharding? Basically, when your bot reaches more than 2,500 servers, you will eventually need to split the bot's proccess using shards so the bot runs efficiently. More information can be found on [discordjs.guide](https://discordjs.guide/sharding/#how-does-sharding-work) and [Discord Developer's Portal](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#sharding).
