## DisTune

This is the new version of DisTune, made fully on JavaScript with the help of the **discord.js** NodeJS library.

Interested in the Skript version? Visit the public archive [here](https://github.com/CerialPvP/distune-sk).

> Why did you move off of Skript?

With every new update of [DiSky](https://github.com/DiSkyOrg/DiSky/releases/tag/4.4.3) (the Skript addon for Discord stuff), the syntax changes drastically. In the lastest update (at the time of writing this, it is 4.4.3), the syntax for sending embeds and storing it has changed, and that will affect most of DisTune's code.

For this reason, I have decided to scratch off DiSky, and decided to start using **discord.js**. Unlike with DiSky, where I came with most knowledge, in JS, I don't really know some stuff.

This is why community-maintained resources such as [discordjs.guide](https://discordjs.guide) are very helpful. **If you need help in coding, checking documentation is your first priority.**
